# FlightBooking
# This project is aim to build a simple flight ticket booking system, which should offer the functions such as 1.Searching;2.Booking3.(If possible AI consultation; 4.User Account Display and Edit; 5. Status of ticket 6. Cancelation)
# The Project involves the Datastructure method ：1. ArrayList--Store the information about the tickets and passengers.2. Queue to add and delete the ticket information.3. We might also use the HashMap to handle the comfirmed tickets.
# We plan to combine these functions with a UI(java GUI/swing), which provides a visiable interface for user in order to have better experience.
